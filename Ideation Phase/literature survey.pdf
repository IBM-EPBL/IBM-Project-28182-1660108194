A Drowning detection system for any pool.

1.The alarm is also provided directly to pool lifeguards via portable radio.
2.This provides a quick reference to the location of the incident.
3.The alarm is also provided directly to pool lifeguards via portable radio.
4.Lifeguards can then visually assess the developing situation,
 within seconds of an incident first occurring.


SwimEye works like an “extra lifeguard” under the water of your pool.
Our object recognition software tracks the movements of all swimmers in a pool.  
And in the event of a serious drowning incident, SwimEye will provide an alarm to pool lifeguards.  
This will help lifeguards improve their reaction-time, as they initiate a rescue.

Poseidon installs underwater cameras to detect drowning accidents in pools more than 2.5 meters deep. 
The specially designed underwater units include dual high-quality optical cameras with a combined field of vision of 180 degrees.
